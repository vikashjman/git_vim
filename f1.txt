Insert Mode: In this mode, you can directly input and edit text. When in Insert Mode, you can type characters, and add, modify, or delete text content as needed. You can initiate Insert Mode by pressing keys such as ‘i‘ (to insert before the cursor) or ‘a‘ (to insert after the cursor). There are also variations like ‘I‘ (to insert at the beginning of the line) or ‘A‘ (to insert at the end of the line). To exit Insert Mode and return to Command Mode, simply press the ‘Esc‘ key.
Command Mode: In Command Mode, you navigate and manipulate text without directly typing characters. This mode is designed for controlling the editor’s behavior and performing various editing tasks efficiently. You can move the cursor, delete text, copy and paste, search for text, and execute a wide range of other editing operations using keyboard commands. To transition from Insert Mode to Command Mode, press the ‘Esc‘ key. The clear distinction between these two modes in Vi is a foundational feature that enables users to edit text swiftly and effectively while minimizing the need for complex keyboard shortcuts.
